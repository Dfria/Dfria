### Hey I'm Dallas,

I'm a recent CS graduate with a passion for data analysis and a strong desire to break into the tech industry. This profile serves as a showcase of my projects and skills as I continue to learn and grow in my field.

My current focus is on building my data analysis skills, particularly in Python, SQL, Excel, and Tableau. 

Please feel free to explore my repositories and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or would like to work together on a project.
