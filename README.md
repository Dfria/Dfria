## Hey I'm Dallas! 

I'm a recent CS graduate with a passion for data analysis and a strong desire to break into the tech industry. This profile serves as a showcase of my projects and skills as I continue to learn and grow in my field.

My current focus is on building my data analysis skills, particularly in Python, SQL, Excel, and Tableau. 

As of 4/4/23, I'm working on this Real World, Fake Data Tableau Dashboard. [Click Here](https://public.tableau.com/views/HRDashboardRWFD_16809252626350/HRDashboardLightMode?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

Please feel free to explore my repositories and don't hesitate to reach out!
